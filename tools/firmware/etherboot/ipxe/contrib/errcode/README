Error Code Lookup for gPXE
==========================
This program looks up gPXE error codes so you can locate the line of source
code which produced the error.

Setup
-----
You must run:
./build_errcodedb.py >errcodedb.py

This extracts error code definitions from the gPXE source code and produces a
"database" which is used by the main program.

Once you have done this errcode.py and errcodedb.py are the only files you
need.  They are now independent of the gPXE source code and can be moved
anywhere.

[OPTIONAL]
A PHP script is provided as a web interface.  First edit errcode.php to point
$ERRCODE_PATH to the errcode.py script.  Then move errcode.php to a location
visible from your web server.

[OPTIONAL]
A simple IRC bot is provided.  Edit gpxebot.py to fill in the IRC details.

Usage
-----
Looking up error codes on the command-line:
./errcode.py 0x12345678
